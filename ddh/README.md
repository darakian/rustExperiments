# The **D**irectory **D**ifferential **H**tool
The H is silent. This tool is called DDH for two very good reasons
* DDT is a dangerous pesticide
* I mistyped when I created the project

DDH takes two directories as arguments and returns the union or disunion (depending on an option third argument).
